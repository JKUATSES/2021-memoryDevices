# 2021-memoryDevices
This is Memory Devices repo for ses projects weekly meetings during the academic year 2021-2022

# Objective
- Understand shift registers and memories.
- Understand memories usage and optimization in Arduino.

# Technologies
- Arduino

# Arduino memories
- Flash - for your sketch
- SRAM - allows manipulation of data and variables
- EEPROM - store data that does not change often.
     - use EEPROM.h
     - has functions such as EEPROM.read, EEPROM.write
